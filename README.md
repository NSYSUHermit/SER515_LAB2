## Discussion
 Strategy and Visitor patterns have total different structures. Strategy can easily encapsulate mutual functions so that all objects can access the same workflow. And Visitor patterns can add new methods in same patterns, which is good at expanding new methods. In this case, I prefer use Visitor patterns because add the new car type process can be more flexible.
